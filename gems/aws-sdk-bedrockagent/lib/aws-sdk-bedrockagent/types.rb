    #   The identifier for the model that you want to be used for

    #
    #   The `modelId` to provide depends on the type of model or throughput
    #   that you use:
    #
    #   * If you use a base model, specify the model ID or its ARN. For a
    #     list of model IDs for base models, see [Amazon Bedrock base model
    #     IDs (on-demand throughput)][1] in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.
    #
    #   * If you use an inference profile, specify the inference profile ID
    #     or its ARN. For a list of inference profile IDs, see [Supported
    #     Regions and models for cross-region inference][2] in the Amazon
    #     Bedrock User Guide.
    #
    #   * If you use a provisioned model, specify the ARN of the Provisioned
    #     Throughput. For more information, see [Run inference using a
    #     Provisioned Throughput][3] in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.
    #
    #   * If you use a custom model, first purchase Provisioned Throughput
    #     for it. Then specify the ARN of the resulting provisioned model.
    #     For more information, see [Use a custom model in Amazon
    #     Bedrock][4] in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.
    #
    #   * If you use an [imported model][5], specify the ARN of the imported
    #     model. You can get the model ARN from a successful call to
    #     [CreateModelImportJob][6] or from the Imported models page in the
    #     Amazon Bedrock console.
